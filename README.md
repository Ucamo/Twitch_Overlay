# Twitch_Overlay
Unity Twitch overlay 

**You can get the latest stable build here:** 
https://el-tutsi.itch.io/twitch-chat-avatars

This is an open implementation of a Twitch chat Overlay based on https://www.patreon.com/posts/making-twitch-in-40078043

You can set up your account and use it on your streams to see your chat interact with your stream.

**You can:**
-Configure how many avatars appear on screen.
-Configure how long should the avatars stay visible after the max number of avatars has been met.

-type !jump on the chat and the avatar of the person who wrote it will do a little jump.


**Instructions:**

It will ask you in the initial scene for your:

-**Username** (Your Twitch username)

-**Twitch Chat OAuth Password:** (you can get it here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)

-**Channel** (The name of the channel that you want to see the chat as avatars, it can be your own or others)

ie: For https://www.twitch.tv/el_tutsi the name of the channel would be "el_tutsi" (and that would also be my Username in my case)



On **Streamlabs** or **OBS** you can add a new source and configure it like this for the Overlay window:
